## Why I Needed a Serious Power Bank

I travel a lot for work - think long flights, airports with scarce outlets, and train rides through areas with spotty power. My phone dying mid-trip went from annoying to genuinely problematic when I started relying on mobile boarding passes and digital hotel keys.

**I needed something reliable.** Not one of those cheap power banks that die after 3 months or claim 20,000mAh but barely charge your phone twice.

## The Anker PowerCore 20000: First Impressions

When this arrived, my first thought was: *"Damn, that's heavy."*

At 12.5 ounces (355 grams), it's got some serious weight. For reference:
- iPhone 15 Pro: 6.6 oz
- This power bank: 12.5 oz
- My wallet + keys: ~4 oz

So yeah, you'll feel it in your bag or pocket.

## Real-World Charge Testing

I ran systematic tests across different devices:

### iPhone 14 Pro
**Battery:** 3,200mAh  
**Charges:** 4.2 full charges  
**Finding:** As advertised. Impressive.

### Samsung Galaxy S23
**Battery:** 3,900mAh  
**Charges:** 3.5 full charges  
**Finding:** Slightly less than iPhone due to larger battery, but still excellent.

### iPad Air (2022)
**Battery:** 7,606mAh  
**Charges:** 1.8 full charges  
**Finding:** Perfect for long flights when I want to watch movies.

## The Travel Torture Test

Over 6 months, this power bank has been through:
- ✈️ 27 flights (including 3 international)
- 🚂 Dozens of train rides
- 🏨 Hotels in 5 countries
- 🎒 Dropped on concrete at least 4 times
- 🌡️ Temperature swings from desert heat to winter cold

**Still works perfectly.** No visible damage, no capacity loss, no issues.

## Charging Speed: The PowerIQ Advantage

Anker's PowerIQ technology actually works. It intelligently detects your device and delivers optimal charging speed:

- iPhone: 2.4A (fast charge)
- Android: 2A-2.4A depending on device
- Tablets: Up to 3A

I can charge my phone from 0-50% in about 30 minutes. That's faster than some wall chargers.

## The Biggest Frustration: Recharge Time

Here's my main gripe - **this thing takes FOREVER to recharge**.

Using a standard 2A wall adapter: 10-11 hours  
Using a 1A adapter: 15+ hours  

That means if you drain it completely, you're waiting overnight to fill it back up. I've learned to top it off whenever I'm near an outlet rather than letting it die completely.

## TSA and International Travel

**Good news:** This is fully TSA-compliant at 20,000mAh (74Wh), well under the 100Wh limit for carry-on luggage.

I've flown with it through:
- US (multiple times)
- UK
- Japan  
- Singapore
- Dubai

Never had any issues. TSA agents occasionally ask about it, I show them the mAh rating on the side, and they wave me through.

## Who Should (and Shouldn't) Buy This

### Buy it if:
- You travel frequently
- You use multiple devices
- You need reliable backup power
- You're okay with carrying some weight

### Skip it if:
- You want ultra-light travel  
- You only need to top off your phone occasionally (get a 10,000mAh instead)
- You want the latest USB-C charging (this uses micro-USB input)
- You need it charged quickly between uses

## Alternatives I Tested

**Anker PowerCore 10000:** Half the weight, half the capacity. Better for day trips.  
**RAVPower 26800:** More capacity but even heavier and more expensive.  
**Aukey 20000:** Similar specs but died after 4 months. Anker is more reliable.

## The Verdict

**Rating: 4/5 Stars**

The Anker PowerCore 20000 isn't perfect - it's heavy and slow to recharge. But it's reliable, actually delivers on its capacity claims, and has survived 6 months of rough travel without issue.

**For serious travelers who need serious power**, this is worth every dollar of the $45-60 it costs. For casual users who just want to top off their phone once or twice, save money and get the 10,000mAh version instead.

## FAQ

**Q: Can you take it on a plane?**  
A: Yes, it's well under TSA limits (74Wh vs. 100Wh max).

**Q: Does it come with cables?**  
A: Yes, it includes a micro-USB cable for charging the power bank itself. You'll need your own Lightning/USB-C cables for devices.

**Q: How do I know how much charge is left?**  
A: Four LED indicators on the side. Each light = ~25% capacity.

**Q: Can it charge laptops?**  
A: No, this only has USB-A ports maxing at 5V/3A. You'd need a USB-C PD power bank for laptops.
