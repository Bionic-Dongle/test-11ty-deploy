We've made over 100 cups of coffee with the Breville Bambino Plus over the past two months. Here's the honest truth about this compact espresso machine.

## Quick Verdict

**TL;DR:** If you want café-quality espresso at home without a massive machine taking up your entire counter, this is it.

**Rating: 4.8/5**

## What Makes It Special

### Heat-Up Time (10/10)
3 seconds. Seriously. From cold start to pulling your first shot in under 3 seconds. This changes everything for morning coffee routines.

### Automatic Milk Frother (9/10)
The automatic steam wand is a game-changer for beginners. Just stick the pitcher under, press a button, and get café-quality microfoam.

**Real result:** Even my partner (who's never made coffee before) pulls great lattes.

### Size (10/10)
Fits easily on small counters. 7.5" wide. Perfect for apartment living or cramped kitchens.

## The Cons

### Learning Curve
Your first 10 shots will be mediocre. That's normal. By shot 20, you'll be making better espresso than most coffee shops.

### Pressure Gauge Would Help
No built-in pressure gauge makes it harder to dial in the perfect shot. You'll need to go by taste and timing.

## Who Should Buy This?

**Perfect for:**
- Espresso beginners ready to level up
- Small kitchen owners
- People who want good coffee without the complexity

**Skip if:**
- You want full manual control (get a Gaggia Classic)
- You need to make more than 2 drinks in a row (small water tank)

## Bottom Line

After 100 cups, the Bambino Plus is still our daily driver. It's not perfect, but it delivers consistent, delicious espresso in a tiny footprint.

For $400, you're getting 80% of the quality of machines costing $1000+. That's a win in our book.
